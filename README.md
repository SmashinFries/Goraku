# Goraku

Goraku is a Japanese media discovery app for android utilizing the Anilist API.

## Features

- Login to Anilist to manage your lists
- Discover Anime, Manga, and Light Novels by pre-selected categories or by using search filters.
- Find tons of information about each media, character, and staff (more coming soon).
- Curious about a character's / VA's kanji? Long press the kanji to find out what they mean!

## About
I started this project as a way to learn JS and React Native. There are still many features to be added so stay tuned.

Updates will be slow because the fall semester has started, but I will be working on new content whenever I'm not studying.

## Notices
- Beware that trending results may not show the correct data at times. I believe this is due to the API, so there's not much I can do.
I recommend waiting for a few minutes then refreshing the page when this happens. 

- If you imported your mal lists to anilist, there will be repeats in your lists. I think this is caused by not having any "updated_at" data so I will have to create a filter. Updating the media will also fix this issue.
