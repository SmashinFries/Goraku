Goraku is a Japanese media discovery app for android utilizing the Anilist API.

## Features

- Find tons of information about each media, character, and staff (more coming soon)
- Curious about a character's / VA's kanji? Long press the kanji to find out what they mean!

## Next Major Update

- User Login / Interactions

## About
I started this project as a way to learn JS and React Native. Goraku is currently in alpha because of the lack of features. Once I complete the next major update, the app will be complete with all core features.

Updates will be slow because the fall semester has started, but I will be working on new content whenever I'm not studying.

## Notices
Beware that trending results may not show the correct data at times. I believe this is due to the API, so there's not much I can do.
I recommend refreshing the page when this happens.
