# Goraku (Alpha)

Goraku is a Japanese media discovery app for android utilzing the Anilist API.

## Features

- Discover Anime, Manga, and Light Novels by pre-selected categories or by using search filters.
- Find tons of information about each media, character, and voice actor (more coming soon)
- Curious about a character's / VA's kanji? Long press the kanji to find out what they mean!

## Next Major Update

- User Login / Interactions

## About
I started this project as a way to learn JS and React Native. Goraku is currently in alpha because of the lack of features and I still think it needs to be more refined before 
adding the next major update.

Updates will be slow because fall semester has started but I will be working on new content whenever I'm not studying.
